This is my first upload on GitHub! 

Performed topic modelling on twitter data extracted using the TwitterScrapper API.
Used NLTK and its dependencies to clean and structure the data.

LDA- Linear Dirichlet Allocation is a topic modelling approach which uses a stastical approach to bucket words into clusters.
Input to the LDA function is a BOW representation of words.
I have considered only Nouns for topic modelling using POS tagging.

Finally we get output of 3 topics, along with the clustered keywords/ tokens from the vocabulary
