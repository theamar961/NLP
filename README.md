# NLP
This is my **first** upload on GitHub! 

Performed topic modelling on twitter data extracted using the TwitterScrapper API.
Here I have used data collected from the hashtag **#bmrcl**.
Used NLTK and its dependencies to clean and structure the data.

**LDA**
Linear Dirichlet Allocation is a topic modelling approach which uses a stastical approach to bucket words into clusters.
Input to the LDA function is a BOW representation of words present in the vocabulary of tweets.
I have considered only Nouns for topic modelling using POS tagging.

Finally we get output of 3 topics, along with the clustered keywords / tokens from the vocabulary.

In the coming weeks, I plan on covering snippets for dependency parsing, similarity index and bigram generation!
